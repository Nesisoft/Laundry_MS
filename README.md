# Laundry management app for settings

I want to build a generalized pickup and delivery SaaS system for laundry service businesses. 
Business Onboarding:
First, we have to physical meet with a business and upon agreement, the business will be registered on our system by entering the business details. Then the system will generate an access_token for the business and send it to the business email provided.
The business will then have to enter the access_token and upon successfully verification, the business will now have access to complete the registration process by providing other relevant details, and also add/create a manager account.
Manager:
The manager can now:
•	Manage services
•	Manage vehicles
•	Manage drivers
•	Manage customers
•	Manage promotional codes (Also including giving them out to customers)
•	Manage pickup requests (including changing statuses of requests, and assigning request to drivers)
•	Manage delivery requests (including changing statuses of requests, and assigning request to drivers)
•	Manage pickup requests payments
•	Manage delivery requests payments
•	Manage orders
•	Manage invoices
•	Manage invoice payments
•	Follow driver delivery routes
•	Follow driver pickup routes
•	View and respond to customer service ratings
•	Send email and SMS notifications to customers
